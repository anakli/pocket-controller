# Pocket Kubernetes cluster setup on AWS

Instructions for seting up Pocket with kubernetes.

## Before you start

Create a pocket-kubernetes VPC, pocket-kubernetes subnet, pocket-kubernetes-open security group and internet gateway. 
Create a s3 bucket for your kops cluster state store. 
Choose a name for your pocket cluster that ends with '.k8s.local', e.g., pocketcluster.k8s.local.

Login to instance in pocket-kubernetes VPC from which you will launch kubernetes.

Install [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops):

```
wget -O kops https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kops
sudo mv ./kops /usr/local/bin/

wget -O kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

```

Install [kubernetes python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python): 

```
pip install kubernetes
```

Install aws-cli. And run `aws configure` to setup your credentials.

```
pip install awscli --upgrade --user
aws configure
```

Ensure your AWS IAM user has the following permissions (see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md) for more details):

```
AmazonEC2FullAccess
AmazonRoute53FullAccess
AmazonS3FullAccess
IAMFullAccess
AmazonVPCFullAccess
```


Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/anakli/pocket-controller
cd pocket-controller/kubernetes
```

## Creating a cluster with kops

Set environment variables:

```
export NAME=pocketcluster.k8s.local
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://pocket-kubernetes-statestore

```

Edit `pocketcluster.k8s.local.yaml` fields for `configBase` and `networkID` to have your S3 statestore bucket and VPC ID.

Start cluster (launch instances with kubernetes services running, e.g., kubernetes API, master with kube ctrlr, nodes with kubelet agents). The cluster config is defined in `pocketcluster.k8s.local.yaml`.

```
cd kubernetes
./setup_cluster.sh
```

Now wait for cluster instances to start. This usually takes about 5-10 minutes. Check the cluster is valid with:

```
kops validate cluster
```

You should see output like:
```
$ kops validate cluster
Using cluster from kubectl context: pocketcluster.k8s.local

Validating cluster pocketcluster.k8s.local

INSTANCE GROUPS
NAME			ROLE	MACHINETYPE	MIN	MAX	SUBNETS
dram-nodes		Node	r4.large	1	1	us-west-2c
master-us-west-2c	Master	m3.medium	1	1	us-west-2c
metadata-nodes		Node	m5.large	1	1	us-west-2c
nvme-nodes		Node	i3.large	0	0	us-west-2c

NODE STATUS
NAME						ROLE	READY
ip-10-1-145-224.us-west-2.compute.internal	master	True
ip-10-1-153-67.us-west-2.compute.internal	node	True
ip-10-1-198-253.us-west-2.compute.internal	node	True

Your cluster pocketcluster.k8s.local is ready
```


If you see an `EOF` error, wait a few more minutes. If the cluster does not enter ready state, check your configuration. Make sure the nodes are running on instances with sufficient resources (avoid t2.micro instances, for example) and the master needs to run on a node with local SSD, e.g. m3 family.

When the cluster is in ready state, patch the cluster to edit the node ingress security group rule and create & attach a secondary interface on the metadata server: 

```
python patch_cluster.py
```

Next, edit IP route table on metadata server:

```
./add_ip_routes.sh
```


## Launching pods

Launch a metadata (namenode) deployemnt. The deployment is defined in `pocket-namenode-deployment.yaml`.

```
python deploy_pocket_namenode.py
```

Now deploy datanode, defined in `pocket-datanode-dram-deployment.yaml`:

```
python deploy_pocket_datanode.py
```

Check status and other useful commands:

```
kubectl get deploy -o wide
kubectl get pod -o wide

kubectl exec -it pocket-namenode-deployment-xxxxx -- /bin/bash
kubectl delete deploy --all
```

## Testing from client container

```
docker run -it --net=host --privileged anakli/pocket-shell

# mkdir /tmp/hugepages
# mkdir /tmp/hugepages/cache
# mkdir /tmp/hugepages/data
# ./bin/crail fs -ls /
# ./bin/crail iobench -t write -f /test.data -s 4096 -k 100 -w 0
```

## Tearing down the kubernetes cluster

Kops will delete all the resources it created (security groups, autoscaling groups, volumes, instances, etc). However, we first need to delete the secondary interface we created for the metadata node (run the python script). 

```
python prep_delete_cluster.py
kops delete cluster $NAME --yes
```
